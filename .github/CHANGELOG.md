## [1.7.3]

## [1.7.2]

### Added

  - True/False values
  - Integer values
  - Multi-sort throttle value

### Changed

- `-SetJavlibraryOwned` now accepts a Path as well as a text list of movie IDs
  - If a path is detected, it will use Javinizer's default movie matching scheme to match IDs (regex-match supported as well)

- Error check to test successful authentication to JAVLibrary before running sort

### Fixed

- Fixed movie count being doubled on sort

### Removed

- Removed verbose messages on GET/POST requests to JAVLibrary when setting owned status

## [1.7.0]

### Added

- Added setting to match JAV files using regular expressions
  - Regex match will not perform any string transformations, so the movie ID in your filename will need to match the website metadata exactly
  - This is intended for users who have previously sorted files using a unique template and are unable to match using Javinizer's default matcher
  ```
  # Default values
  [General]
  regex-match=false
  regex=([a-zA-Z|tT28]+-\d+z{0,1}Z{0,1}e{0,1}E{0,1})(?:-pt){0,1}(\d{1,2})?
  ```

  - -Entries <Int>
  - -Order <String> (Asc, Desc) Default: Desc
  - -LogLevel <String> (Info, Error, Warn, Debug)
  - Examples:
    - `Javinizer -ViewLog List`
    - `Javinizer -ViewLog Table -LogLevel Error -Entries 10`
    - `Javinizer -ViewLog Object | Where-Object {$_.message -like 'Skipped*'}`

## [1.4.0]

### Added

- Ability to select which file extensions to use with Javinizer with setting `included-file-extensions`
- Ability to exclude files that match a string/wildcard value with setting `excluded-file-strings`
  - This uses the `-Exclude` parameter on cmdlet `Get-ChildItem` which supports string paths/strings with wildcard (\*) Regex is NOT supported
- Ability to omit the creation of a nfo file for a movie with setting `create-nfo`
- Ability to create a nfo file per movie file sorted (for multi-part videos) with setting `create-nfo-per-file`
  - This is now set as default, as this is a requirement for metadata to be loaded with movies into Emby/Jellyfin
- Better logging functionality and setting of a static log path with setting `log-path`
  - View logs from console with `Javinizer -ViewLog`
  - Output as a PowerShell object, so you can specify pipeline elements (e.g `Javinizer -ViewLog | Select-Object -First 10 | Sort-Object timestamp -Descending | Format-Table -Wrap`)

### Changed

- Removed r18 from default description
- Logging to JSON formatted

### Fixed

- Parameter `-MoveToFolder` and `-RenameFile` to set true/false value for `move-to-folder` and `rename-file` in the commandline
  - Example: `Javinizer -Path C:\Downloads\JAV-Sorted -Recurse -MoveToFolder:$false -RenameFile:$false`
  - This is for when you want to refresh metadata for already sorted videos but don't want to manually adjust your settings file

### Changed

- Default naming of `poster.jpg` -> `folder.jpg`
  - This allows the poster image to show up as the default folder thumbnail in Windows File explorer
  - I have not noticed any issues with Plex/Emby/Jellyfin for this naming convention but let me know if there is a conflict
- Default throttling of thumbnail updates to 5
  - Requests have been erroring out due to the speed of the requests and Cloudflare throttling
- Update check will only occur once per session by checking global variable

### Fixed

- Actresses from DMM not being properly added to nfo when `first-last-name-order=false`
